Titanic Prediction of Survival based on Age 



1.The Titanic prediction problem involves predicting whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not, given various features such as their age, gender, and class. This is a classic binary classification problem.

2.To solve this problem, we can use various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.

3.The first step in solving this problem is to preprocess the data and handle any missing values or outliers. We can also create new features such as family size and cabin information from the existing features.

4.Next, we can split the data into training and testing sets and train our machine learning model on the training set. We can then use the testing set to evaluate the performance of our model.

5.Finally, we can use our trained model to make predictions on new data.

There are many resources available online with detailed tutorials and examples on how to solve the Titanic prediction problem. Some popular platforms for solving this problem include Kaggle and DataCamp.
